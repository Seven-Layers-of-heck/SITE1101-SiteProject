### 📚 Reading
I enjoy reading books, especially those related to technology, computer science, and operating systems. I particularly love the Fantasy genre, diving into epic worlds of magic and adventure that spark my imagination. Reading helps me stay updated with the latest trends and deepen my understanding of complex topics while also providing an escape into fantastical realms.

### 🐧 DistroHopping
As someone who uses Arch BTW, I love exploring different Linux distributions. I already have experience with Linux Mint, Fedora, Endeavour, and Arch. I also own a disk with 14 different distributions for testing and exploration. DistroHopping allows me to:
- Experience different desktop environments
- Learn about various package managers
- Understand different system architectures
- Compare performance and usability

### 🎥 Video Creation
I create videos as a hobby, which helps me:
- Share knowledge with others
- Document my learning journey
- Improve my communication skills
- Express creativity through digital media
