**Description:** First SITE Project, where we learned about logic gates' structure, boolean algebra(AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR) and digital circuit. The best of it was hand experience and has practice of doing it, compared to other projects, where there was only theory.

**Technologies Used:**
- Breadboard with all curcuits and components
- Arduino
- 4 Brains
- Patience

**Features:**
- Team Work
- Hard Skills
- Interpersonal Relationship

## Project 2: Hour Of Code

**Description:** Second SITE Project, where we went to school and taught school students about Algorithms and AI. I think, it was remarkable particularly, due to the experience of the teaching and also due to the place we visited.

**Main Components:**
- Car
- Camera
- Laptops
- Projector
- Desire to learn something

**Features:**
- Team Work
- Teaching
- Learning, as you need to understand the topic to convey it, like you are explaining it to 5 years old
