Your website should have the following pages: 
- Home Page with a profile photo and a text summarizing who you are, etc. Which would be like

Perfect! I've created your personal website with all the requested pages. Here's what I've set up:

## Website Structure:

1. **Home Page** (`index.markdown`)
   - Features your profile photo (placeholder created)
   - Personal introduction as requested
   - Clean, professional layout

2. **About Page** (`about.markdown`)
   - Your background from Azerbaijan
   - Education details (IT studies)
   - Skills section (HTML, CSS, Jekyll, Git, etc.)
   - Interests in operating systems and computers

3. **Projects Page** (`projects.markdown`)
   - Project 1: Personal Website
   - Project 2: Hour of Code (optional)
   - Space for future projects

4. **Hobbies Page** (`hobbies.markdown`)
   - Reading
   - DistroHopping
   - Video Creation

## Configuration Updates:
- Updated site title to "Mustafa Jan Yeshil"
- Updated description to reflect your IT focus
- Maintained your existing GitHub and Reddit usernames

## Next Steps:
1. Add your profile photo to the `assets/` folder and name it `profile.jpg`
2. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to preview your site locally
3. Add screenshots or images to your projects as you complete them

The site uses Jekyll with the Minima theme and will work perfectly with GitHub Pages using your existing configuration. All pages will automatically appear in the site navigation.
